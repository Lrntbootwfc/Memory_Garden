# MemoryScape Garden
A 3D Visualization of Digital Memories
This repository contains the frontend component of the MemoryScape project, an interactive 3D garden where digital memories are brought to life. It serves as a visual and emotional interface, transforming a collection of photos and videos into a vibrant, navigable world.

The garden is designed to feel like a living space where memories don't just exist, but grow. Every memory is rendered as a unique, interactive flower. By navigating the scene and clicking on a glowing flower, users can trigger a holographic display to view the photo or video associated with that moment.

# Features
Interactive 3D Scene: Explore a detailed 3D environment with smooth, responsive camera controls.

Dynamic Object Rendering: Memories are dynamically rendered as distinct flower models.

Holographic Display System: A custom particle and shader effect creates a floating, holographic display for viewing memories.

Performance-Optimized: The scene is built to render smoothly, even with a large number of objects.

# Technology Stack
The garden is built on a modern and powerful web development stack, focusing on performance and immersive visuals.

React: For a structured and component-based frontend architecture.
Three.js: The core 3D library used for all rendering and scene management.
React-Three-Fiber: A React renderer for Three.js that simplifies managing the 3D scene's state and components.
React-Spring: For physics-based animations that give the scene a fluid, natural feel.
